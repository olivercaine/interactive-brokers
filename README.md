## Notes

Enable connnection from TWS
    API settings -> make sure "Only allow localhost" is disabled.

Correct data is node reqHistTickData.js
    But it's the "historicalTickTradeData" type.

Connector only works from backend.
Next step: write socket on backend then add one to client pulling in the data.
Can get Mike's ip from Control Panel->WiFi.
